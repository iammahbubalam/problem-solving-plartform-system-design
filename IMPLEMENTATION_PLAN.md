# üöÄ COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING PLATFORM - IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

## üìÅ **SEPARATE REPOSITORY STRUCTURE**

Each microservice will be its own Git repository:

```
üì¶ Individual Repositories:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service/              (Repository: auth-service)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-service/              (Repository: user-service)

## üö¶ **NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

1. **Create shared-contracts repository first**
2. **Setup local development environment**
3. **Create auth-service as the foundation**
4. **Establish development workflows and standards**
5. **Begin with local Docker Compose setup**

This roadmap ensures each service can be developed independently while maintaining proper integration points and dependencies.
